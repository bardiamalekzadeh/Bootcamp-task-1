# FrontHooks Bootcamp - Task 1: Card Panel

This is my first task from the FrontHooks frontend bootcamp.

The project is still **in progress** — I'm planning to make a few minor updates based on mentor feedback soon.  
Once completed, this notice will be removed.

## About the Project
This task was about creating a card panel layout.  
I decided to add my own touch by using color variations for the cards.  
I’m primarily focused on frontend development, not UI/UX design — so the color choices might not be perfect.  
Still, I wanted to explore beyond the default theme and came up with this idea myself.

Built with **HTML** and **CSS**, following the **BEM naming convention**.  
I tried to apply everything I've learned so far in the bootcamp's HTML/CSS modules.
