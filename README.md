# ðŸŸ¦ Card Panel Project

## ðŸ“¦ About the Project

ðŸ§© This is my first task from the **FrontendHawks Bootcamp**.  
The task was to create a **Card Panel**, and as you can see, I designed it with separate colors for each section.  

ðŸŽ¨ I must admit I'm not a designer â€” I'm a frontend developer â€” so if some of the colors seem to clash, I apologize! The idea to use color separation was entirely mine, even though the original task asked for a normal theme.

ðŸ›  The project is developed using **HTML** and **CSS**, and I followed the **BEM** methodology.  
Iâ€™ve tried to apply everything I learned throughout the HTML & CSS phase of the bootcamp.

ðŸš§ **Note:** This project is not finished yet. I will keep updating and improving it over time.

Thanks for checking out my project! ðŸ˜Š  
More projects are coming soon...
